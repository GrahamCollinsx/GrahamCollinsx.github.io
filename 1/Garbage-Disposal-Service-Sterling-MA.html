<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the approach laid out above. Because the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is specifically true when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

When you tighten up the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.
