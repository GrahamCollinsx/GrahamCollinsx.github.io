I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

To prep your unit for installation, you may have to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug package that I purchased individually from the disposal unit. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Although the professional agreed that the client did the right thing in her attempts to tighten the pipes, the specialist saw that the pipe had actually ended up being very corroded for many years and that a PVC pipe may be much better fit for the client's requirements. He shut off the water supply to the house, eliminated the corroded system and fit a PVC pipe in its location. Before leaving the home, the professional brought back water flow and checked the pipe.</p>
