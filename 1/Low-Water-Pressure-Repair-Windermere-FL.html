A few of the reasons for drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a stopping working garbage disposal, or too much food being disposed down the drain. We will usually advise our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending upon the intensity of the circumstance. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has actually raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells foul, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
<p>If you find a leak and opt for a patching job instead of a repiping job, just remember that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the exact same material and they may be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your whole house when you identify a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backward.</p>
