<p>A lot of toilets utilized today operate with a basic gravity flushing design, meaning they utilize the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and after that on into the sewer system. Recently, however, toilets using a vacuum flushing system have been appearing in a growing number of homes.

Prior to leaving the house, the technician restored water circulation and checked the pipe.</p>
