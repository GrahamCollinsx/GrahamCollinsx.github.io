Nonetheless, it adds a fair amount of performance to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a reasonably little cylindrical device set up under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal unit takes down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such debris. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly stream into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes.

The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be tested annually. Likewise allows provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need an each year test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated yearly to insure the safety of the potable drinking water in your house.
