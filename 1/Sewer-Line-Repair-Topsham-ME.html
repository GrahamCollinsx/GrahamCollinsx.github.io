When the pressure drops for some reason such as might happen when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to combat a water or a fire main breaks or some other situation takes place, contaminated water may be drawn into the system. To prevent such an incident, there requires to be some kind of backflow prevention technique used. The best and best type of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component).
