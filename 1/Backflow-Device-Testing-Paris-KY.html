<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Sadly, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is simply recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
