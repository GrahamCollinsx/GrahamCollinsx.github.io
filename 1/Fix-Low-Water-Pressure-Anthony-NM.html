<p>When the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>

Brooks discovered only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
