<p>A new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of worn thin pipe and the painting the within the used pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes.

Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be properly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>

Inspections should be made after foundation excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (before hiding work), and upon conclusion. KEEP IN MIND: If faulty work is discovered, the inspector will provide an infraction notice, and a particular amount of time is allotted to remedy the issue.</p>
