<p>Lubrication might help with the positioning of some parts within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any better, it is just there to help the professional put together the elements into the body without creating damage from friction. The lubricant needs to be a food grade lubricant to guarantee the water supply is not infected. In most cases the very best lube is water. The normal use for lube in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be lightly lubed to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. The use of excessive lubricant can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to wear or stop working out sooner by drawing in dirt and particles or restricting the motion of the component. The correct quantity of lube must make the surface of the 'ring appear wet. You need to never ever see pieces or globs of lubricant.</p>
