<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Reno NV?</h3>

For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water.

But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of home centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet.
