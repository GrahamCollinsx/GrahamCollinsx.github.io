<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
<p>To the end user (consumer), SpringWell Water (SpringWell") warrants that the following Covered items- retention tanks and mineral tanks (14" or larger) will be without any flaws in product and craftsmanship for a period of 10-years under normal application, service and usage. They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, however I give the company props for calling to update us on the later arrival time. Some jobs take longer than expected, that's easy to understand, by keeping us notified of the minor delay, we didn't need to stress.</p>
