<p>A license and inspections are required for a lot of residential jobs including porches, additions, and devices such as air conditioning system and hot water heater. If new work is performed such as replacement of gas piping, a plan might be essential to obtain the permit.

Clogged blockage and drainage problems might begin as minor problems but can rapidly accelerate into significant problems. A clogged drain can even lead to sluggish water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and costly repairs.</p>
