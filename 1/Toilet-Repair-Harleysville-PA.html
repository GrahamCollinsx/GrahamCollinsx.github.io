The height is needed to overcome the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its design and lack of moving parts. However, it might be impractical in lots of situations to install a pipe section of this length. Furthermore, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
