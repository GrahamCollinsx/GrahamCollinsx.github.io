<p>Your sewer line problem can result in sewer backups, and they usually take place in the most affordable open drain. This kind of issue is typically the outcome of an obstruction in the line. If you do not discover the smell originating from the sewer backup, you may identify this issue due to the fact that a backup occurs whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house is dependent upon the main sewer line for appropriate drainage. If, however, just one drain has backup problems, there's a separated issue with only that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage issue.</p>
