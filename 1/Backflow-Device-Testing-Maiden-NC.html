<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it should be restored (cleaned up). Salt is usually utilized in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>

Toilet leaks around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
