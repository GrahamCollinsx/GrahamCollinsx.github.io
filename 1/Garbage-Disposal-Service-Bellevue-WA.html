<p>Trees and shrubs are a common cause of sewer obstructions to the house. Roots can become the smallest fracture or space in your house's drain pipe, where they thrive in the nutrient abundant environment offered by the sewer. Flat roofs normally have actually drains spaced out around their perimeter.
