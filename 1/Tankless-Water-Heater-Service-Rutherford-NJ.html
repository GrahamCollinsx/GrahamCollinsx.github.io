<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
