<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
