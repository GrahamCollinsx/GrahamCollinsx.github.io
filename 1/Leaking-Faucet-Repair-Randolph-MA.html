Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

Your garbage disposal includes a. hex wrench that can be utilized to place into the opening situated at the bottom of the system. Try to insert a broom plunger or manage into the sink drain opening and attempt to rotate the jammed flywheel if you can't find this wrench.
