Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these events.</p>

<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow of water which might bring unclean water or other, dangerous compounds into the public supply of water and personal plumbing.
