<p>Disconnect system from electrical, drain and sink. Dispose and eliminate of unit. Backflow is the unwanted flow of water or other liquids, mixes, gasses or compounds into the drinking water system. In the majority of states, except Kansas, you are responsible for any gas piping on your home from our gas meter to your house or company.

A great way to decrease the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a waste disposal unit. Rapidly and efficiently removing leftover potato peels, fruit rinds and lots of other types of food waste, the disposal grinds all of it into great particles that are eliminated of the chamber and into the house drainage, waste and vent system or what you probably call your sewer.</p>
