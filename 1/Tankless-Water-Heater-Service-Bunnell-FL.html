For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to harden and break or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the location.

Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever remains in tip-top shape.</p>
