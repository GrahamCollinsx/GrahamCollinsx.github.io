Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
