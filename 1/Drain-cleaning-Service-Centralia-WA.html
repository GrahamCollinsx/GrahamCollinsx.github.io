<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The simplest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is required to conquer the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its design and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it might be not practical in many situations to install a pipe section of this length. Additionally, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
