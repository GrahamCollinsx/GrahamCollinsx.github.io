<p>Leaks can take place if the seal in between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain stops working. Either of these leakages can be difficult to fix on your own because the tank or the entire toilet need to be taken off the floor for a proper repair. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a a lot more costly repair. Ryan's Plumbing has carefully trained personnel who will treat your toilet and home with the utmost care.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to provide decades of protection. There are many local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water turbidity, quality or temperature level can all trigger the assembly to weaken in its efficiency.
