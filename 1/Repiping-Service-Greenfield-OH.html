<p>It could be a leak you can't see if you observe your water bill increasing. Call us for our leak detection service today. If you see absolutely nothing obvious, place the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the unit, and twist ideal and left. Check that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then attempt the reset button if the motor spins freely.

<p>Do you need a replacement for an older system that's become frustrating, or simply for a new look? How about for a building addition or significant remodel? Once again, that's something you might do yourself, although it's generally much better to work with an experienced sink plumber in the San Diego area. Installation includes over a lots steps, and removing the old one includes a lot more operations. It can be tough comparing eliminate and fixture holes, and getting the new installation flat and level with whatever sealed up.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to press the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>

Higher horsepower: Horse power (HP) measures how effective a waste disposal unit is. Garbage disposal HP varies from 1/3 to 1, however for the majority of single-family houses a 1/2 or 3/4 HP system will work just fine. If you have a large household or do a lot of cooking, you may think about a 1 HP waste disposal unit.</p>
