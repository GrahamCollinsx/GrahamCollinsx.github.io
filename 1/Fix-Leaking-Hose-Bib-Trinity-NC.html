Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water.

This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank replenished.</p>
