For home, it is necessary for owners to signal the District if any changes are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial home, the District evaluates using each new tenant. The correction needs to be made before water service is allowed if the current backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the occupant or the property owner.</p>
<p>Water softeners generally use sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are supplied from liquified sodium chloride salt, also called brine. In the ion exchange procedure, salt ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that look like wet sand. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to possible contamination or poorer quality water, need a backflow prevention device.</p>

There are two kinds of standpipe systems, the very first type, are dry systems, which generally contain no irreversible water system and are pressurized through a fire department connection by fire personnel reacting to an incident. A dry standpipe system requires no backflow prevention protection. The 2nd type is a wet standpipe system which is usually linked to the buildings safe and clean water supply and requires the installation of a check valve assembly.</p>
