Our group of extremely experienced experts will lessen the impact our work has on the structure of your home or office and get your system working rapidly, securely, and affordably. Water hardness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium.

Which's where the term solidity" originated from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>
