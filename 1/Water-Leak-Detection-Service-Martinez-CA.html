<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be gotten rid of by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Again, it is recommended to check the manufacturer's directions for unique preventative measures.</p>
