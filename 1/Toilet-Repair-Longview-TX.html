Typically, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs complete water turned off while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience very little interruption to your daily routine.

Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
