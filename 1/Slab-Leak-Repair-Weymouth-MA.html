<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Weymouth MA</h3>
<p>This is an entirely legitimate question that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, naturally, as essential as your water heater, water line, or drains. Nevertheless, it adds a reasonable amount of functionality to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a fairly little cylindrical device set up under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
