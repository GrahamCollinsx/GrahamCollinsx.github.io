Professional sewer and drain companies like Roto-Rooter have the ability to remotely line the area of the pipe that is broken without needing to dig a trench.

<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
