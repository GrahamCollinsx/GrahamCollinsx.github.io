<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly in Wilmington CA</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains significant quantities of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its many desired uses around your house.</p>
