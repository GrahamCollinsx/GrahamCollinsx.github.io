Typically, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires total water turned off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience very little disturbance to your day-to-day regimen.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
