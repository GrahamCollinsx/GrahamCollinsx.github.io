<p>Close all outside windows and doors and switch on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a nearby warm water faucet up until you hear the gas burner in the water heater spark. After a minute, move a smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Photo 7) on top of the heater. The smoke should be prepared the vent pipe. If the smoke doesn't draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Switch off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to fix the problem.</p>
