<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite direction from its typical flow. IRWD's drinkable water system is created to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply deviate from "regular," the direction of water circulation can be reversed. This creates a backflow condition and the capacity for contaminated water entering the safe and clean water circulation system. Copper is a biostatic material, which means germs will not grow on it. Copper has been used (in addition to PVC pipes) because the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old buildings. It is particularly useful for cold and hot faucet water and refrigerant lines in HVAC systems.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to provide years of security. There are many regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water quality, turbidity or temperature level can all cause the assembly to deteriorate in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies may seldom need repair while some are repaired on a regular basis. The test data from the field test will determine the repair frequency.</p>
