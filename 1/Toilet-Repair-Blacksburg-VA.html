If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To prevent this, ensure the new waste disposal unit installation package includes a tube, or purchase one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>
