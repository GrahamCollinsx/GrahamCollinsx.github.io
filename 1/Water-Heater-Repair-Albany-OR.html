<p>Those of us in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in lots of locations have significantly lowered the number of reported events that take place within our water systems. This has at times led to individuals thinking that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever really have been an issue in the first place. This thinking can be both unsafe and counterproductive. Backflow occurrences in water systems are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a reduced pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing method to backflow security.

Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from going into the garbage disposal, so you're just sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
