This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise. A word to the wise: most house owner insurer will pay to repair a water leak and water damage to your home twice. But if it happens a third time, you run the risk of having your insurance company drop you. To begin with, any Sarasota County citizen who has a watering system or a well is needed to install a backflow preventer at the water meter (due to the fact that both systems are at threat of contamination due to backflow).</p>
