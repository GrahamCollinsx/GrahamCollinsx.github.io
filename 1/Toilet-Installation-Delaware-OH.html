<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is usually used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
