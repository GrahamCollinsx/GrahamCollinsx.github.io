About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is utilized throughout the backflush operation. What we suggest is that your toilet is old. Older toilets may work just fine, but if your toilet is truly old (and dated in design), you might want to think about a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.
