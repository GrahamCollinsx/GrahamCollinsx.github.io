<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
