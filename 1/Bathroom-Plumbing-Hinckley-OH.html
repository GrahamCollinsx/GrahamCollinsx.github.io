<p>One of the most common toilet problems that we get required are problems with toilet obstructions. Nevertheless, there are a number of various problems that can occur to your toilet. Although some toilet issues may not look like they are worth the problem of calling a plumber, disregarding the issue may be costing you money or even worse - lead to a more severe problem.

<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
