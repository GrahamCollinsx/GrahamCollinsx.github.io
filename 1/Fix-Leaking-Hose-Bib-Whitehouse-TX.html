<p>Backflow is bad news. Clamp the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the diminished brine solution after the regrowth cycle. Secure the drain hose firmly and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hoses need to have an air space. The end of the hose be at least 2 inches above the dedicated drain. An air space may be utilized to attain this, and might be required depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>

<p>Reducing or eliminating water hardness is made with a piece of equipment referred to as a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange process takes place. A softener is comprised of different parts, each having their own distinct purpose. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel usually built out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with adversely charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener depend on the control valve or softener head as it is frequently referred to. Most popular water softeners have an automated regenerating system.  The most standard type has an electrical timer that recharges the system and flushes on a regular schedule.</p>
