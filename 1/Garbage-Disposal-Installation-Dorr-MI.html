<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it difficult to access to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big job, replacing exposed pipes in a basement, utility, or crawlspace  room is relatively uncomplicated, due to the fact that the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets ought to definitely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet should be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
