<p>If you home utilizes a septic system and drain field, you'll need a special garbage disposal. The system needs to grind the waste even finer to avoid obstructions and enable the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. Once, the gas pipe comes up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, however needs to then shift to galvanized. I am not sure why that must be.

If these connections are not properly secured, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be pushed into the potable supply system. Backflow Preventer definition: A device that enables water to go through it in one instructions, however avoids it from reversing in the opposite direction.</p>
