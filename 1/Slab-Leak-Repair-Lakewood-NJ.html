As a result, we suggest replacing your unit if it is over ten years old. Under no situations should you ever attempt to fix gas leaks yourself. Contact a membe rof our gas pipe installer group to receive support with a gas line repair, installation, or replacement project in the Chicago suburbs.

Constantly continue to run water during and after using your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has vanished down the drain. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
