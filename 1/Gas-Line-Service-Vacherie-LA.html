<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it challenging to gain access to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

Toilets should definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet needs to be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
