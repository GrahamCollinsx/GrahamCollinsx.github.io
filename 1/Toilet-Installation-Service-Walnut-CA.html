<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
