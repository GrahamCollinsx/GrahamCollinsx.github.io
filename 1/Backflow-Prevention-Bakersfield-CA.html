<p>The garbage disposal is humming, however not turning. The garbage disposal has actually become jammed. NEVER STICK YOUR HAND INTO THE DISPOSAL if IT IS JAMMED. Even if the system is off, the blades are sharp and unsafe. Make sure the unit is off, you can even turn off the breaker to make certain it can't be switched on by mishap. Your waste disposal unit comes with a. hex wrench that can be used to place into the opening located at the bottom of the system. If you can't locate this wrench, then attempt to insert a broom plunger or manage into the sink drain opening and attempt to turn the jammed flywheel. If it appears to be moving easily turn the system back on (and do not forget to turn back on the circuit breaker if you don't it off) and see if the system is working.</p>
