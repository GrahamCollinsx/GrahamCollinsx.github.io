If you can't locate this wrench, then attempt to insert a broom plunger or manage into the sink drain opening and attempt to turn the jammed flywheel. If it appears to be moving easily turn the system back on (and do not forget to turn back on the circuit breaker if you don't it off) and see if the system is working.</p>
