<p>This 3-stage water treatment system with a stainless steel filter media tank will filter and soften your water for several years to come. Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows occur from them, these water features are thought about a health danger. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area must be suggested on building and construction strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond should be evaluated upon installation and after that each year.</p>
<p>A few local authorities need that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the high end of the irrigated area. It might not be set up in any place where it might ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not allow the usage of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some don't allow the usage of a PVB at all, so consult your water supplier. A PVB backflow preventer might spit or spill water out from under the cap when backflow happens, so it needs to be set up in an area where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
