The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if required. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it challenging to gain access to in-wall pipes, think about at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge job, replacing exposed pipes in a basement, utility, or crawlspace  room is relatively uncomplicated, because the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets must definitely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>

<p>Leaks can take place if the seal in between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain fails. Due to the fact that the tank or the whole toilet must be lifted off the floor for an appropriate repair, either of these leakages can be hard to fix by yourself. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a far more pricey repair. Ryan's Plumbing has carefully trained workers who will treat your toilet and home with the utmost care.</p>
