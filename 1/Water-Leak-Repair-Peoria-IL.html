<p>Search for a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will flow backwards into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these occasions.</p>

<p>As soon as the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut off stays in the closed position.

A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>
