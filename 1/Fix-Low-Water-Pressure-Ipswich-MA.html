Age-- As we mentioned, a 10+ years of age water heater is probably on its last legs. If you are not sure how old your system is, you should have the ability to get that details from the identification number on the maker's sticker (typically near the top of the unit). Usually, the first two numbers suggest the year of your water heater.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems use UV light to ruin micro-organisms and offer purified water. The energy source required to heat the water is cheaper. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water firmness can be eliminated fairly quickly by using an ion exchange treatment. Standard water softeners are cation exchange gadgets. Cations refer to positively charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the firmness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>Standard water softeners found in home supply and hardware shops will remove almost all the calcium and magnesium from the raw water during the softening process. Softeners also will remove approximately 10 parts per million (ppm) of iron and manganese. Water products with high levels of iron and manganese (greater than 10 ppm) may need pretreatment to prolong the life-span of a water softener. The effects of a malfunctioning toilet vary significantly-- from the mild annoyance of a tank that will not stop going to the unhygienic and possibly disastrous back-up of unflushed sewage.
