The zinc finish on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with wetness. While it does its job quite well, over time, it still does wear away. We can help if you are currently experiencing clogged drains! When one or more of your drains are clogged, water will typically begin to support into your sink, which can result in weird smells. A blocked drain can likewise cause problems when flushing the toilet and cause other drain issues, like water leaks and bursting pipes.</p>
<p>Water softeners come in all sizes and shapes and larger definitely does not imply much better. WaterBoss ® utilizes fine mesh resin - smaller sized beads that really provide more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to permit optimal capability in a minimum of area. Plus, our patented Directional Flow Screen system assists ensure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter likewise protect the resin bed, so we do not need to waste space on freeboard" which is the empty area in traditional water softeners that permit a churning of resin during regrowth to release sediment, dirt and hardness.</p>
