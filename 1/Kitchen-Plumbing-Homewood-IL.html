<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Since water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily kept for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
