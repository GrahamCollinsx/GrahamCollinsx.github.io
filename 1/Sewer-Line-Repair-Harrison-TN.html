<p>Finally, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best used in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>

And if your house is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal specifically developed to be utilized with a septic system. offers a summary 1 of garbage disposals and septic tanks.</p>
