<p>Unless your bathroom restoration is purely cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might effectively become part of your project requirements. Water gets in the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads.

The mineral deposits cling to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and streams throughout the house. Tankless innovation makes good sense.
