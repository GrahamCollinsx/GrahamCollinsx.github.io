<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly constant, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly kept for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
