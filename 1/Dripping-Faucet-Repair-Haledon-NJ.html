<p>Finally, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in critical locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
<p>There are 2 popular mount systems utilized for garbage disposers: the basic 3-bolt mount (if you've had a disposer set up for some time, it's probably installed in this manner) and a more recent system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a comparable system called "Quick Lock"). Each achieve the very same task with little difference, aside from their installation. As the name indicates, the EZ Mount system is intended to be simpler to handle when fixing an unit or installing.</p>
