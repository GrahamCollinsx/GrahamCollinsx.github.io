Backflow is the undesirable circulation of water or other liquids, mixtures, gasses or substances into the drinking water system. In many states, except Kansas, you are responsible for any natural gas piping on your home from our gas meter to your home or company. Atmos Energy does not preserve the natural gas lines on your property beyond our meter, this is the exact same as other energies, such as your electrical circuitry and pipes.</p>
<p>With special root nozzles, we can clean and clear most of the roots, rust, and debris to prepare the line for possible CIPP lining reinstatement if the pipe needs to be fixed. The water pressure in the hydro jetting procedure can be controlled to accommodate particular drains like kitchen sinks, floor drains, storm or drain systems, and main sewer lines. We have portable electrical systems for inside your house or business and big gas and trailer units for outside problems. This system not just clears the drain of noticeable blockages but cleans up the drain of waste build-up, restoring its original diameter and making hydro jetting a service that can be counted on for maintenance efforts.</p>
