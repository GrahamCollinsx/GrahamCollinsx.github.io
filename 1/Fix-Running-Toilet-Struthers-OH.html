Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
