Some do not permit the use of a PVB at all, so talk to your water service provider.

The piping system shall be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not show the minimum pressure required for the test, or any decrease of test pressures as shown by pressure evaluates during inspection will be deemed to suggest the presence of a leak.</p>
