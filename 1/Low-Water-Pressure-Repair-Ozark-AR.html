<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>Where the company is located: Beware of contractors who offer you a post office box with no street address or use just an answering service. Never work with somebody who comes unsolicited to your door and can't offer you proof of credentials-- specifically if he or she pressures you to employ quick and pay money in advance. Grey = End-User Pressure - water pushes past the # 2 check valve into the system of completion user. The # 2 Examine prevents backflow triggered by pressure increases in the down stream plumbing.</p>
