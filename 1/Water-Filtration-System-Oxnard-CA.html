I actually received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange).

The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
