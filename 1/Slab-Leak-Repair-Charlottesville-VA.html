For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure.

The consumer has 1 month to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notice of Requirements form). Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer.

<p>Sadly, when water is totally stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently ends up being corrosive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, specifically in locations where water sits for long periods of time.

Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas hot water heater with unique venting systems also are available. However they're more difficult to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
