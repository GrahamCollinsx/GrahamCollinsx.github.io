When water flow stops, pressure vacuum breakers use a check valve created to close with the aid of a spring.

Attempt freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
