If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve.

After mounting the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
