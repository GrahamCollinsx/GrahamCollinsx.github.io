When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your home.

Salt is usually utilized in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
