<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close.
