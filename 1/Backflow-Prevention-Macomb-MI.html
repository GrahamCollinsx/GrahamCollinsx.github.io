Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
