<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
