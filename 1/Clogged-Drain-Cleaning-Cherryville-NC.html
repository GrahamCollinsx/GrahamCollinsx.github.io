<p>Sodium intake from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Substituting potassium chloride for salt chloride may be proper if health or ecological reasons necessitate restricting sodium. Gradually, the beads become covered with minerals and need to be cleaned up. This cleaning process, called regrowth, has 3 cycles: backwash, recharge and rinse. The regrowth process can be arranged automatically with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
<p>For starters it will probably have difficulty keeping up with the flow of water and will begin to flood the area.

In cases where the clog can not be found immediately we'll use our inspection video cameras to examine the storm drain system from the within with a real-time camera feed. We'll have the ability to identify the exact area of the clog and what's causing it.</p>
