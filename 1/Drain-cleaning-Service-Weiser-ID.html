<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water travels through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
