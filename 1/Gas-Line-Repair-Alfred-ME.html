<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at Alfred ME</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use.
