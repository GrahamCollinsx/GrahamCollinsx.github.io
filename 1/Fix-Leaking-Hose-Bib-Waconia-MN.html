<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the method set out above. It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up because the baffle effectively halves the interior diameter of the tee. When the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is specifically true. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
