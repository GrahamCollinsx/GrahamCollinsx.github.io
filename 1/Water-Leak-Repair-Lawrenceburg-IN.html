Subsequently residential licenses provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated annually. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an each year test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before running the watering system.
