<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to business? The timing of regeneration depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, no matter whether the water actually needs it. When needed, more recent systems use electronic sensors that keep an eye on bead deficiency and other key metrics based on your water use and therefore just regenerate. These newer systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect since they save energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
