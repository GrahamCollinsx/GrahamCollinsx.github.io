The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide need to be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material.
