<p>In local supply of water systems, water is typically preserved at a significant pressure to enable water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or business. When the pressure drops for some factor such as might occur when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to eliminate a fire or a water main breaks or some other circumstance takes place, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an event, there requires to be some type of backflow prevention approach used. The best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air gap is not possible, then the appropriate backflow prevention device is required. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Epa and your water provider.</p>
<p>The term hard water" may seem like an oxymoron, but it's just household water which contains high concentrations of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. These minerals do not make water unhealthy to consume. They likewise are relatively undetectable through odor or taste, but they can be damaging just the same. Just like our trenchless services, we will initially conduct pipe leak tests utilizing video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
<p>Standard water softeners discovered in house supply and hardware shops will remove nearly all the calcium and magnesium from the raw water throughout the softening process. Softeners also will remove as much as 10 parts per million (ppm) of iron and manganese. Water supplies with high levels of iron and manganese (greater than 10 ppm) may need pretreatment to lengthen the life-span of a water softener.
