<p>Replacing the ring that seals the connection between the bowl and the sewer line means completely removing the entire toilet. So it's a. good time to consider getting a brand new toilet.

The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion helps require it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
