<p>Salt-free systems will also minimize scale buildup and offer brighter clothing and softer skin using a much healthier approach. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the capability to soften water without needing to add sodium to the water. This is a more heart healthy and eco-friendly system. Conventional salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative impact on people with high-blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high sodium content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and use no drainage, no electricity and no salt or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are incredibly low maintenance because the media can last as much as 5 years without replacing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be replenished on a month-to-month basis.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly need to be tested yearly. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked every year to guarantee the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
