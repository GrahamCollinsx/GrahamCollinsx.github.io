<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Zeeland MI</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Often a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly need to be checked each year. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an each year test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be checked yearly to insure the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
