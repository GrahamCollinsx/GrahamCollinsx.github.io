<p>Backflow prevention devices are developed to protect the public water supply from cross-connections. A modern community water supply system is developed to ensure that water streams to homes and structures under pressure. This community water network contains many users where there is a threat to public health if there is a cross-connection between the supply of water and a polluted source. A cross-connection can happen where there is a pressure drop in the water pipe. This pressure drop causes a vacuum and siphons of entrainment water from end-users into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>If a gas water heater or an electrical system is more cost-effective, house owners often ask. The answer depends upon your house.

Electric ranges are likewise much easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less most likely to lose heat.
