<p>Backflow preventers should only be fixed when the data gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has actually degraded in its performance listed below the established minimum standard. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if necessary, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This indicates the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>

<p>An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the first check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. An RP works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be used to separate health or nonhealth risks.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
