A video inspection is frequently needed to find the source of the recurring problem.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To remove the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise till the system falls away. Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
