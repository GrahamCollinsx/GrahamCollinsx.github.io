The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if needed.

<p>When you turn your watering system on, it's a good concept to test your backflow assembly every spring. However, we hardly ever recommend CPVC when a whole house needs repiping. The pipes can end up being brittle, with time, and might require replacement quicker than hoped. Some states require steamfitters and pipefitters to be licensed; they may also need a special license to deal with gas lines. Licensing typically requires an exam or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board for additional information.</p>
<p>More complex is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has actually discovered widespread use considering that it avoids both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are arranged in line with the pipeline and operate independently of each other. A set of 4 test dicks enable the operator to analyze the valves and ensure they are not being required open by built up particles. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to permit water at expected operational pressure to flow through.
