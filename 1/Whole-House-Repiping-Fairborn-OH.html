<p>Finally, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
