<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly need to be tested every year. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the watering system.

If health or environmental reasons require restricting sodium, replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride may be suitable. With time, the beads end up being covered with minerals and need to be cleaned. This cleaning procedure, called regrowth, has three cycles: recharge, rinse and backwash. The regeneration process can be arranged immediately with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>

Houses that use gas for heat or for other different devices have a gas line that links straight to the heating system, water heater, stove, and other home appliances that utilize gas.
