The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if required. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>ENERGY STAR certified models are readily available for water heater tanks.

When picking your brand-new tank unit, ask your trusted Home Depot professional for more details. To keep your sink smelling fresh and running clear, gather equal parts of vinegar and baking soda regularly. For regular cleaning, you'll simply need about one-half cup of each.
