<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Many people do not understand that they are in fact accountable for some sections of gas pipelines in and around their house, but it is extremely important to keep in mind.

If you water with safe and clean water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, potable and irrigation, you are also required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
