Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
