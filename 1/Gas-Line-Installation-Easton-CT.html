<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
