<p>Irrigation backflow devices are developed for installation on safe and clean water lines to safeguard against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of infected water into the drinkable water system. While there's not an exact schedule as to when you should repipe your house, you must definitely look into repiping if they haven't been done in 50 years or more-- especially if you reside in an older home built closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our air conditioning system and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech explain exactly what was wrong with the unit, how he repaired the problem, and how to avoid a reaccuance. I would extremely suggest Hunter for any issues you might have.</p>
