The tank flushes itself when certain levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank replenished.</p>

<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Washington NC</h3>

<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
