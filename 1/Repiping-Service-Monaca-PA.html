<p>The normal option is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older house (built pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately experiences corrosion and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Given that I like to prepare, I generate a great deal of dishes. We set up a momentary workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, however after a day of this we understood that we required the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the house within thirty minutes and he ensures that the sink will stay clog-free for 30 days. If it clogs once again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!  We are extremely pleased that we chose Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will certainly use this company once again and again in the future.</p>
