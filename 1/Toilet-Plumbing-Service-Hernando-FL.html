<p>To help avoid obstructions within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the technique laid out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle efficiently halves the interior diameter of the tee. This is especially true when the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
