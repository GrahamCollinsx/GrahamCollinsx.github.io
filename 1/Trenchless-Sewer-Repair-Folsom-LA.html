Installing a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will usually range from $300 to $800 depending on the length of the pipe needed. If you're transforming your house to gas, or if the present line is at capability, expect to spend $2,000 or more. Brand-new gas line expenses consist of appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
