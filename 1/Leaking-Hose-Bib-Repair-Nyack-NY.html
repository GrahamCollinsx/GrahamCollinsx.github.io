<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems.

Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
