<p>Unseen sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain pathway, small pipes range from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a bigger one beneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the home. A great way to lower the quantity of food waste in your kitchen is to install a waste disposal unit. Rapidly and effectively removing leftover potato peels, fruit skins and numerous other types of food waste, the disposal grinds all of it into fine particles that are flushed out of the chamber and into the house drainage, waste and vent system or what you probably call your sewer.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the right length for your new disposal.

(Loosen up the other pipe connections, if required, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation set includes a tube, or buy one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
