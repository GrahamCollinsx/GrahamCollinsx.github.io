<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver female thought the rate she paid for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things differently could have conserved her a lot of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To remove the disposer, support it from below and turn the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
