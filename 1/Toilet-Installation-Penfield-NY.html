<p>Last but not least, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>

An RPBA is effective against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be utilized to isolate health or non-health dangers.</p>
