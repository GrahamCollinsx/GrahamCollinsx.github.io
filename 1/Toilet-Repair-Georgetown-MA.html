In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly.
