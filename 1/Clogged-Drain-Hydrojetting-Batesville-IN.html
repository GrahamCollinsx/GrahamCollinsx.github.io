Double flush valves are becoming increasingly more typical, as both consumers and producers look for new ways to save water. Double flush toilets permit the user to select the level of water needed to flush the toilet based upon whether the waste is liquid or strong.

Well, many people find that squicky - and so the dual flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're just utilizing less water to do it.</p>
