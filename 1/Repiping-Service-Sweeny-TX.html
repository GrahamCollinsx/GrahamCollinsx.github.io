<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems use UV light to damage micro-organisms and supply purified water. The energy source required to heat up the water is more economical. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water hardness can be removed fairly easily by using an ion exchange procedure. Standard water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations refer to favorably charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the firmness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this brine passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This process continues until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about totally regrowed.</p>
