We extremely suggest repiping your house during spring or summer season so you don't have to worry about freezing temperatures throughout the repiping procedure if you live in a cold-weather environment. Normally, if the issue is confined to one sink or shower, drain cleaning is likely the best solution. When more than one drain is slow or clogged, it can show a bigger problem with your plumbing system.
