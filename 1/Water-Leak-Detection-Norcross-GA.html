If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could take place.
