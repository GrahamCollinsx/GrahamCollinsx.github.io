<p>Gas and gas that comes out of the ground is completely odor-free. The egg smell related to gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety preventative measures you should require to secure yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, since every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
