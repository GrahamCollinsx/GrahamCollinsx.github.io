<p>Re-piping is a process of replacing the supply pipes in a dwelling or business. It is not a temporary fix or a replacement of brief areas of pipe, but a total replacement of your supply plumbing system. There are several factors you may need to repipe your house or organisation. Rust of pipes may cause low water pressure, rusty colored water, reduced water flow, or leaks. , if you are going to redesign it is a great time to repipe before you paint or finish your walls..

If you notice an isolated leak or a small part of your existing piping leaking, or valves that are corroded or split, it is quite perhaps an indication of a bigger problem.</p>
<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
