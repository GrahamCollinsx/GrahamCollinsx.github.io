<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads become filled with salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. Tough water causes gray or white deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these signs.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
