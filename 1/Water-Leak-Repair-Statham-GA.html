If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security precautions you need to require to secure yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise permit options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
