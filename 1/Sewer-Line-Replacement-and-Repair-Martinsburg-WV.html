<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
<p>However, you also need to think about the age of your system.

The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
