<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a process called ion exchange to eliminate tough water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical procedure called Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This process converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a solidity crystal that will not adhere to any surface area in your house, keeping your appliances and warm water heaters without hard water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are likewise referred to as water conditioners because they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it. And since these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to remove caught ions.</p>
