<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design).

This process continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about fully restored.</p>
