<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This procedure continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered totally restored.</p>
