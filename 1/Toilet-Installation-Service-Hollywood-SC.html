<p>Natural Gas and gas that comes out of the ground is totally odor free. The egg odor associated with natural gas is a chemical blended into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are security preventative measures you must take to secure yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions also enable options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water.
