<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing interruption service might seem like a waste of money. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will suffice?

Handling repairing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the cost savings sustained from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>There are 2 popular install systems utilized for garbage disposers: the standard 3-bolt install (if you have actually had actually a disposer installed for some time, it's probably mounted this way) and a more recent system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a comparable system called "Quick Lock"). Each achieve the very same job with little distinction, aside from their installation. As the name suggests, the EZ Mount mechanism is intended to be much easier to handle when fixing a system or setting up.</p>
<p>Stainless-steel blades are usually preferred because they're less prone to rust. Other great alternatives are overload security, which shuts off the motor if it starts to overheat; an auto-reverse function to avoid jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the dirty dishes get ground up in the disposal. And if your house is on a septic system, you'll need a disposal particularly developed to be used with a septic system. gives an introduction 1 of waste disposal unit and septic systems.</p>
