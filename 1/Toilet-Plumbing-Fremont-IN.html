<p>Some makers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

The test duration will not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall hold up against the test pressure defined without showing any proof of leak or other flaws. Mechanical gauges used to measure test pressures will have a variety such that the highest end of the scale is not greater than five times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will require an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be carried out using a 50 pound gauge, however not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not show the minimum pressure required for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as indicated by pressure assesses during inspection shall be considered to show the presence of a leak.</p>
