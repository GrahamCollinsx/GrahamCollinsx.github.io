<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
