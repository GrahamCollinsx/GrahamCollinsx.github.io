<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are a lot of quality kitchen sinks to choose from. For instance, many consumers choose stainless-steel undermount sinks due to the fact that they can take a fair bit of abuse over the years. Enameled cast iron sinks are also back in favor, and they are available in a wide variety of designs. You also need to decide about whether to have a single or multi-bowl  sink. The size of the bowl in addition to further options relating to the faucet are all aspects of the process that we can help you with.</p>
