Whereas warm water heaters utilized to come in either tank or tankless choices, there are now even more alternatives for enhancing water heating energy intake. Tankless Hot Water Heater - If you are tight on space, or if you have an interest in minimizing energy expenses when heating water for usage throughout your home, then you may wish to think about the installation of a tankless hot water heater. Such designs heat water on-demand, meaning that you pay to heat just the water that you need, as you need it.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
