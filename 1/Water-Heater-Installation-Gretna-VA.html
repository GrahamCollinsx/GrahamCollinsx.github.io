<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive.

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
