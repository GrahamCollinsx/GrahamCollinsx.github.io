The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply motion. This opposite flow is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to escape. Sometimes no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down lead to a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>

<p>Your initial step is to turn off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5). Examine the instructions if your valve is a different style from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
