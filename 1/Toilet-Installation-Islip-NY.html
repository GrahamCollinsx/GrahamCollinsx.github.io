<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home.

Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>

When linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is connected. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to link wires precisely, and the base covered to secure the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>
