<p>Regrettably, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently becomes destructive. Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main cause of the blue and green discolorations being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas hot water heater with special venting systems also are readily available. However they're more difficult to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
