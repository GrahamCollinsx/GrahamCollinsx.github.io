<h3>Find Registered Plumbers in  Lindon UT</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>Take the example of the instantaneous hot shower that uses the point-of-use water heaters; these devices will supply hot water constantly for the duration you are using the shower. They will stop to work only if there are power issues or if the water heater is malfunctioning. In essence, it heats up the water on demand with just the quantity you need, therefore removing the loss incurred with the use of tank water heaters where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
