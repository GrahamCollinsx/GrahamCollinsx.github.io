<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily stored for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
