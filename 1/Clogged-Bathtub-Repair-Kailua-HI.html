By changing the bicarbonate, magnesium, and calcium ions that cause water hardness with salt or potassium ions, the EC4 softens difficult water by resolving its source. Additionally, thanks to its distinct, integrated microprocessor, the EC4 system will learn your normal water use patterns, changing its soft water delivery based on your requirements.
