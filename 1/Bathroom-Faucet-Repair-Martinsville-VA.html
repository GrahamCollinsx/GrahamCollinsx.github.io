<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Since water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly kept for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
