<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
