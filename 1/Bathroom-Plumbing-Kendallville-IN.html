According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The average per capita water use daily is greater in rural counties than city counties in all the climate regions, other than in the Central and Southeast regions"1 with rural areas having less efficient water supply systems2 mostly due to the relative lack of financial resources to upgrade and keep their systems.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks beverages. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
