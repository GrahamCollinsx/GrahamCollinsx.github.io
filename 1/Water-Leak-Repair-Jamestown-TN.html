I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
