This has at times led to individuals thinking that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there may never really have been an issue in the very first location. This thinking can be both unsafe and detrimental. Backflow occurrences in water supply are an outcome of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a minimized pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or absolutely nothing method to backflow defense. We need to look at each installation for the risk it provides and after that install the appropriate defense.</p>
