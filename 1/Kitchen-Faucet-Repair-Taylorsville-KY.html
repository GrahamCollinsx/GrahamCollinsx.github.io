<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this salt water goes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about completely restored.</p>
