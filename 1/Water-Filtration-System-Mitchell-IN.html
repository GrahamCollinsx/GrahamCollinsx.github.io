<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a threat to the digestion system.

This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
