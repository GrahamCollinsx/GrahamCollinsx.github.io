Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
