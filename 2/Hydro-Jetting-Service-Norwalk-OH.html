<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
