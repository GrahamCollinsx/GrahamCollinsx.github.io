Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
