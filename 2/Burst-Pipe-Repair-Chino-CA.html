<p>Searching for timely Albuquerque emergency plumbing services? The third main component of a water softening system is the brine tank. The brine tank is essentially a storage tank for salt chloride (NaCl) or potassium chloride (KCL) which is blended with water during the brine refill and regrowth cycles.

Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
