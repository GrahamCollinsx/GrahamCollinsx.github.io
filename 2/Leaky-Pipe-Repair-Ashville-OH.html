<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds.
