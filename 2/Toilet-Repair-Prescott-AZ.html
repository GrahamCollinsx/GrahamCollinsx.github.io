<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked each year. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an every year test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked yearly to guarantee the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
