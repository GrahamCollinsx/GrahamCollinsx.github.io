<p>Lubrication may aid with the positioning of some parts within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any much better, it is just there to help the professional assemble the components into the body without developing damage from friction. The lube should be a food grade lubricant to guarantee the water supply is not polluted. Oftentimes the best lube is water. The usual use for lubricant in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be lightly oiled to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. Making use of too much lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to use or fail out quicker by attracting dirt and debris or limiting the motion of the component. The proper quantity of lubricant must make the surface of the 'ring appear damp. You should never see chunks or globs of lubricant.</p>
