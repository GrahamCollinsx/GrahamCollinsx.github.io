<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Florence KY</h3>
<p>Toilets are one of those plumbing fixtures that we frequently consider granted-- they're long-lasting, durable, and quite consistently there for you when you need them. Also, toilets use up such a big part of your bathroom that many people are beginning to take them into account when upgrading their bathroom design choices. However that does not indicate toilets are best-- gradually they will need to be repaired when something goes wrong, and they may even ultimately need to be changed. Whether you're wanting to fix or install a new toilet up the one you have so it works like new again, you can depend on the Sterling plumbers from Donmar Heating, Cooling & Plumbing to do the job.</p>
<p>Your first step is to turn off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5). Inspect the directions if your valve is a different design from the one we show. After installing the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
