<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains substantial quantities of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its lots of intended uses around your home.</p>
