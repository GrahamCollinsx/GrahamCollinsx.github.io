These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
