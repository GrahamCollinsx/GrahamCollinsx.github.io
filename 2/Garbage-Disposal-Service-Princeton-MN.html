<p>In municipal water system systems, water is generally kept at a substantial pressure to enable water to flow to and out of the plumbing components in your house or service. When the pressure drops for some factor such as may take place when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to fight a fire or a water main breaks or some other situation takes place, infected water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an event, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention method used. The very best and best kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component). The appropriate backflow prevention device is needed if an air gap is not possible. This backflow device is thought about a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>
