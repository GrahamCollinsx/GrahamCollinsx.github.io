<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
