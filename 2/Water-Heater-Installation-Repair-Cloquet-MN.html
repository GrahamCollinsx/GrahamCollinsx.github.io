<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well maintained to help avoid leaks and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to solidify and crack or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space along with it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place.
