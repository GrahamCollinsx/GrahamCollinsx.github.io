The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to escape.
