In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are caught and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any remaining contaminants.</p>
