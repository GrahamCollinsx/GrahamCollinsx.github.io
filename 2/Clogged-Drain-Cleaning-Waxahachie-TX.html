<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and quickly be disposed of through the sink, this big amount of trash does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without restraining water flow. By installing a waste disposal unit you are assisting the environment by saving the amount of trash that gets sent to landfills and other discarding areas. With a garbage disposal the garbage is managed through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
