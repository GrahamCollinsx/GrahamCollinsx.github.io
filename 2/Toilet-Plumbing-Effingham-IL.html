<p>David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors. He called numerous of his member contractors to learn what a sensible and fair cost would be for a garbage disposal install. Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- typically salt. The outcome is water that's been effectively softened by removing almost all traces of the minerals that constitute hard water.</p>
