<p>Your primary step is to turn off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5). If your valve is a various design from the one we show, check the directions. After installing the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
