<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. If you live in an older home (built pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing, this is an option to consider.

<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.
