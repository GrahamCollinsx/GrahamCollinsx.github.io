If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different style from the one we reveal, examine the directions. After installing the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
