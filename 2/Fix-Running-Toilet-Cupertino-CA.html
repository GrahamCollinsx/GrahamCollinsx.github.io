Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers need to be tested occasionally to ensure they are operating properly. A visual check of air gaps is sufficient, however mechanical backflow preventers have to be checked with properly calibrated gauge devices.</p>

Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
