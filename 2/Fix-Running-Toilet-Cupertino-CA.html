Big Blue Plumbing can buy and handle the license procedure. Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that go through fouling, use or tiredness. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers need to be tested occasionally to ensure they are operating properly. A visual check of air gaps is sufficient, however mechanical backflow preventers have to be checked with properly calibrated gauge devices.</p>
<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
