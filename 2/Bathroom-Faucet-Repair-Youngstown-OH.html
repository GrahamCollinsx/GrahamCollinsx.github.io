<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes at Youngstown OH</h3>

Excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
