<h3>Leaking Faucet in Seekonk Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated every year. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be tested each year to insure the security of the potable drinking water in your house.
