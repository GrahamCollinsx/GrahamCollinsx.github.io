<p>The next step for a hopeful plumbing contractor is to make a contractor's license. Licensed plumbing contractors can own their own plumbing business and hire or subcontract work to other licensed plumbers. State licensing requirements for plumbing contractors typically consist of paying an application fee and passing a thorough service, law and building regulations exam. Some neighborhood colleges and technical schools provide contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Additional requirements for prospective plumbing entrepreneur may include evidence of financial reliability, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Department of the Structures, Security Engineering and Environmental Department is responsible for making sure that plumbing systems and knowledgeable trade persons remain in compliance with code and ordinance requirements.

A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
