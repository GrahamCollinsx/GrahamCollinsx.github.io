Consequently residential permits provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked annually. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an annually test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated each year to guarantee the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
