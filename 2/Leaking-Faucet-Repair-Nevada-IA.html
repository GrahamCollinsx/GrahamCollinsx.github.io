<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin has actually already been fouled. Again, it is a good idea to examine the producer's directions for special safety measures.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are a lot of quality kitchen sinks to choose from. For example, lots of consumers pick stainless steel undermount sinks since they can take a fair bit of abuse over the years. Enameled cast iron sinks are likewise back in favor, and they come in a large range of designs. You also need to decide about whether to have a multi-bowl or single sink. The size of the bowl along with further options concerning the faucet are all aspects of the process that we can assist you with.</p>
