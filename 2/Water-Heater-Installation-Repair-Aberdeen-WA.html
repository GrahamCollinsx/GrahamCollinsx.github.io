<p>Finding a plumbing contractor, either a company or person, is a bit harder. For brand-new house construction, your general contractor or home builder will likely advise a plumbing contractor that he recognizes with and has actually dealt with in the past. When we secure the present toilet one has installed we willcheck all the plumbing lines to ensure they are in good condition. This will help make certain that the new toilet installation is not going to produce a water leak in the old pipe that might not have the ability to handle the strain of having a brand-new plumbing installation connected on it.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many home centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
