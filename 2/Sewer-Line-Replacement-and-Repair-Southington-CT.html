<p>To assist avoid clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the method set out above. Due to the fact that the baffle efficiently halves the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially true when the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
