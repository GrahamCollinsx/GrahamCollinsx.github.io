<p>Camera are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Include an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting spring-loaded, air inlet valve. We'll show you three common gas piping circumstances. We'll show you one way to make each connection, however there are other similarly legitimate methods utilizing common plumbing parts. Don't be puzzled by the labels FIP and MIP; they just stand for female pipe threads and male pipe threads, respectively. And when you buy the parts, do not think twice to request for aid. Then screw all the gas line parts together to make certain they fit.</p>

<p>We aren't here to sway you in one instructions or the other - we install both gas and electric hot water heater - but we wish to inform you on the advantages and downsides of both so you can make the choice that best fits you.
