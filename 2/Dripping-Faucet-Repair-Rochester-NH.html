I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
