A video inspection is most often needed to discover the source of the recurring issue.</p>
<p>. Toilet repair is probably among the most popular searches on the web for do-it-your-selfers. This is because most people take a look at a toilet that is leaking, continuously running, or stopped-up and think they can fix it themselves. Why not? It looks like an easy repair.

<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive.
