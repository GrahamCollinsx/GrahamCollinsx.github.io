<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Millsboro DE</h3>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
