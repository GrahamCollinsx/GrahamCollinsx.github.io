<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions guarantee the safety, security and constant performance of research study, vacuum, and industrial procedure systems. If pushing down on the flapper stops the sound, the flapper isn't sealing under regular pressure. Switch off the water, flush the toilet to clear the tank and then run your finger around the rim of the flush valve seat.

If cleaning the flush valve seat does not fix the problem, you need to replace the flapper.</p>
