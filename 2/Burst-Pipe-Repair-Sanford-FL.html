The type of brand-new faucet you pick may be restricted by the variety of pre-drilled holes in your existing bathroom or kitchen countertop. We had some household coming to remain for graduation weekend and we needed a brand-new hot water heater before they got here. We searched for a bit, however we got the very best quotes from Blue Frog. They were able to send out somebody out within a day or so. He was extremely friendly and good.
