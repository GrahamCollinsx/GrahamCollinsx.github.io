<p>Natural Gas and propane that comes out of the ground is completely odor-free. The egg odor connected with gas is a chemical blended into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety preventative measures you must take to safeguard yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions also enable alternatives to backflow preventers.

This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
