If you have kids, you may not wish to live in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Pipe Relining - This is an economical service to repairing pipes.

Our technicians will insert a resin-saturated felt tube, which permits the resin to harden and form a brand-new, strong pipe within the harmed pipe.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe.
