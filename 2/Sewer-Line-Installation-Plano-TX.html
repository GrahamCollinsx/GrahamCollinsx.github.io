<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it should be restored (cleaned up). Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>

<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly constant, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily kept for later use when need rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
