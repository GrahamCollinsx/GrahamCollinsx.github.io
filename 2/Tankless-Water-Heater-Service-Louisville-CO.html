More recent units use digital sensing units that monitor bead depletion and other essential metrics based upon your water use and for that reason only regenerate when needed. These more recent systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal since they conserve energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
