Whether you need garbage disposal repair or installation, Maeser can assist. A waste disposal unit is a necessary kitchen appliance in a lot of homes today. While most kitchen sink disposers can handle almost any kind of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other item jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Used impellers on older disposals can become inadequate, increasing the danger of drain clogs.</p>
