<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Florence OR</h3>
<p>The nationwide typical cost to repair a dripping faucet is $65-$ 150, but the cost may be higher, depending on the nature and reason for the leak. Common water heater problems consist of lukewarm or cold water, a leaking tank or scalding water. The cause of these problems can be challenging to determine, so it is very important to work with a professional plumbing contractor who is familiar with the understanding required to locate the problem and make the proper repairs.</p>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close.
