<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

<p>Installation and replacement costs are often similar, though replacement normally will not require service charges, such as application charges. New meters should satisfy guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas providers may require an unique meter for their services, restricting your choices. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number noted on the building license. Inspections should be made after foundation excavation (prior to pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon conclusion. KEEP IN MIND: If defective work is discovered, the inspector will release an offense notification, and a particular time period is allotted to remedy the problem.</p>

Cations refer to positively charged ions dissolved in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the firmness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
