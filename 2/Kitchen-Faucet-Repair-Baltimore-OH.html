The consumer has thirty days to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notice of Requirements form). Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer.

<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily kept for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
