They do not have a sprinkler system, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention. The primary difference among water softener designs is in the way they schedule the backflush cycles. Because recharging the beads with salt too early wastes salt and water, this is important. Charging far too late causes performance to fall off.</p>

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a procedure called ion exchange to eliminate tough water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical procedure referred to as Design template Assisted Condensation (TAC). This procedure transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that won't adhere to any surface in your house, keeping your devices and warm water heaters devoid of tough water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also called water conditioners since they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And since these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to remove recorded ions.</p>
