<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

A drain expert like TLC will use a camera to examine your drain system. Often, if you have numerous drain problems you may have a drain line break someplace in your home or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can recognize the problem and locate so the drain can be fixed.</p>
