<p>Lubrication might help with the placement of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any better, it is only there to help the technician put together the parts into the body without creating damage from friction. The lubricant should be a food grade lube to assure the water system is not polluted. Oftentimes the best lubricant is water. The usual usage for lubricant in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings ought to be gently lubricated to guarantee they do not present of their retainer. Making use of too much lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to fail or use out quicker by attracting dirt and debris or limiting the motion of the component.
