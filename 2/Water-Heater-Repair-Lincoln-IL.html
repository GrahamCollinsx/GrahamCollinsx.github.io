<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) requires plumbing contractors to acquire a plumbing authorization prior to installing or replacing a backflow preventer. Your water heater. The pro will next inspect your water heater. With your water heater, she or he is looking at water temperature level, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless hot water heater ). Some will also flush your hot water heater at this time, which is an annual maintenance task that prevents tough water and sediment accumulation. To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to wash out any buildup.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To remove the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
