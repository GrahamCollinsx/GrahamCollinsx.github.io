In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>

These more recent systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect since they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
