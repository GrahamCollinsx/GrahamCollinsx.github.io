More serious cross-connection threats may require an unique type of backflow preventer that can immediately discharge possibly contaminated water before it goes into the general public water system.

<p>In unusual circumstances a CPVC repipe maybe recommended where the water PH levels are a problem. With this approach, our specialists make insertions or holes at both ends of the harmed sewer pipe. They then place a brand-new replacement pipe on one end and pull it through the old pipe's path utilizing a hydraulic machine. This triggers the old pipe to burst or split in order to replace it with a brand-new, more powerful, leak-resistant and highly durable sewer pipe without needing to dig up the old one initially.</p>

From new bathroom fixtures to custom-made countertops, we truly have everything. Our inventory makes us the very best plumbing company for any task in Seattle, WA.

<p>IRWD is devoted to delivering safe, high quality water to consumers. Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water delivered to our customers is kept free from hazardous contaminants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices consisting of a nonpotable substance, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination may happen when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating and cooling system, into the drinkable water system. This can occur through a process called backflow.</p>
