The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

Some neighborhood colleges and technical schools provide contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Extra requirements for prospective plumbing company owner may include evidence of monetary reliability, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>
