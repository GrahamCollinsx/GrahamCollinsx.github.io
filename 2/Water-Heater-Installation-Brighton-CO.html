Inspections ought to be made after foundation excavation (prior to pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon completion. KEEP IN MIND: If malfunctioning work is discovered, the inspector will release a violation notification, and a specific amount of time is allotted to correct the problem.</p>
