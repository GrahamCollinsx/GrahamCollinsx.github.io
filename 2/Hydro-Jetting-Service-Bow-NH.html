<h3>Leaking Shower in Bow New Hampshire</h2>
<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
