Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.
