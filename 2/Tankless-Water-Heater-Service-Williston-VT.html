This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is needed to overcome the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simplicity of its style and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it may be impractical in numerous circumstances to install a pipe segment of this length. In addition, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a process called ion exchange to remove hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical process called Design template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This process converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that will not adhere to any surface in your home, keeping your devices and warm water heaters free of hard water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are likewise referred to as water conditioners since they do not really soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And since these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to get rid of captured ions.</p>
