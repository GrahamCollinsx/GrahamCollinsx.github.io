<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks beverages. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made of copper.

The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
