<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it must put something back into the water.

This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these.

Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to get away. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
