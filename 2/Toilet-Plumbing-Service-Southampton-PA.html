<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario.

The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
