Subsequently residential licenses issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be tested every year. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to operating the watering system.
