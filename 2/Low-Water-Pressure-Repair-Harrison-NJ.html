<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Harrison NJ</h3>

Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use.
