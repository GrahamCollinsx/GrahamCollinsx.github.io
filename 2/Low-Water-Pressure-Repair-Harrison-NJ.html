<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Harrison NJ</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will stream in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
