<p>To help prevent obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the method set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. When the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
