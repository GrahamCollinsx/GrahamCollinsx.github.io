Then it's most likely that branch of the system has a clog someplace, if you notice a large puddle where a storm drain need to be.

A PE or RA can help identify if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
