<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
