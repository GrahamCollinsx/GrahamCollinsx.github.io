<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. happens when there is a decline in provided pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to leave. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down lead to a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to supply years of security. There are many local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water turbidity, temperature or quality can all cause the assembly to weaken in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies might hardly ever need repair while some are repaired regularly. The test data from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
