<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this brine goes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely restored.</p>
