<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Chesnee SC</h3>

We service pipelines throughout the state of Georgia, from Atlanta to Athens, Savannah to Augusta, Macon to Marietta, GA, and beyond.

<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange install) enough to press the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
