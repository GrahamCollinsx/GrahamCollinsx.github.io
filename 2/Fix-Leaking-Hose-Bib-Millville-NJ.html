<p>Leakages are tricky. While the time required will vary based on your house size and the variety of discovered malfunctions, it's best to set aside approximately two hours when you schedule an inspection. There's always the chance that your plumber's previous task will run long and delay the beginning time.

When you call to schedule your appointment, ask how long the inspection usually takes.</p>
