<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems.
