<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The most basic backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is essential to get rid of the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming.

Additionally, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
