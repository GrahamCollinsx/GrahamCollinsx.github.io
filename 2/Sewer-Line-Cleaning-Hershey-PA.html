<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be checked each year. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated yearly to insure the security of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
