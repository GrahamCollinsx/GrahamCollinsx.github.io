Some cities are beginning to ban salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the waste water. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and utilize no waste water, no salt and no electricity or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are exceptionally low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last as much as 5 years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be renewed on a month-to-month basis.</p>
