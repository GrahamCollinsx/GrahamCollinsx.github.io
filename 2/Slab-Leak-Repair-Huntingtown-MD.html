<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Considering that I like to prepare, I produce a great deal of meals.

Toilet-flushing is the single most water-intensive activity in the majority of homes and represent over 30 percent of overall household water usage. Toilets made before the 1980s may use up to seven gallons of water per flush (GPF.) Many are still on the task and still squandering water. Later models from the 1990s cut GPF in half.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly need to be evaluated each year. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an each year test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested annually to guarantee the security of the potable drinking water in your home.
