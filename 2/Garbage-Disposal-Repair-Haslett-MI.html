<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
