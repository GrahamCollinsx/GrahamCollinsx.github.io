<p>Irrigation backflow devices are created for installation on safe and clean water lines to safeguard against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of polluted water into the potable water supply. While there's not an exact schedule regarding when you need to repipe your home, you should absolutely look into repiping if they haven't been done in 50 years or more-- specifically if you live in an older house built closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our a/c unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech describe just what was incorrect with the unit, how he repaired the issue, and how to avoid a reaccuance. I would highly suggest Hunter for any concerns you might have.</p>
<p>One method we identify backflow danger is by asking consumers to finish a Backflow Assessment Form to gather more info about their water use.

Are Allows Necessary? California State Contractors License Board and your local town need a building permit for hot water heater replacement and new setups.
