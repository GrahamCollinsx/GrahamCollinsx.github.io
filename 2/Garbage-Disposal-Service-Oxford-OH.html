<p>Spotty meals? Just because a toilet is still functioning and has not become completely disabled does not imply that it might not still need to be repaired. If a toilet often obstructs, constantly runs when not in usage, leakages, or lacks flushing power, Master Plumbing & Mechanical can get it back running at optimal effectiveness. It helps to understand the brand and model of your toilet. The brand name is generally on the bowl behind the seat. In many cases, the design or number will be on the underside of the lid or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can become a trial-and-error procedure. Even professional plumbers often try two or three flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>
