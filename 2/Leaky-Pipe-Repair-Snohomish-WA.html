<p>Unseen sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a different drain pathway, small pipes range from the tub and sink to eventually meet a bigger one underneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the house. A great method to decrease the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a waste disposal unit. Rapidly and efficiently removing remaining potato peels, fruit rinds and many other kinds of food waste, the disposal grinds it all into great particles that are eliminated of the chamber and into your home drainage, waste and vent system or what you most likely call your sewer.</p>
