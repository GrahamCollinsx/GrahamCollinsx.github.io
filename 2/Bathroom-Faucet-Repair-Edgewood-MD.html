<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors. He called numerous of his member contractors to discover what a reasonable and fair cost would be for a garbage disposal install. Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- generally salt. The result is water that's been successfully softened by removing almost all traces of the minerals that constitute difficult water.</p>
