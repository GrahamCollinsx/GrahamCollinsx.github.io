This device includes no less than five individually operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline.

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection.

When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
