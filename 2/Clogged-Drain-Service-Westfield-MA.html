These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily stored for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
