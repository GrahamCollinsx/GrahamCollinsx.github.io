<p>Most of the times, the gas leak is caused by a change that somehow affects the gas lines. Something as unimportant as moving a gas clothing dryer for any purpose whatsoever can harm the gas pipe. Gas lines which are flexible are susceptible to leaking and crimping, others made from inappropriate, low-grade material also end up being fragile quickly and corrode away, triggering a serious leak. Lot of times, an installation by less than professional also trigger gas leaks. Which is why we are always recommending to just rely on the most knowledgeable, professional, and licensed plumbers for installation and gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
