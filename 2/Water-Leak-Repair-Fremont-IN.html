The Supertech serviced our air conditioner unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech explain exactly what was wrong with the unit, how he repaired the problem, and how to avoid a reaccuance. I would highly advise Hunter for any problems you might have.</p>

An approved, appropriately installed and preserved backflow assembly essentially gets rid of the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage.

Set the height before you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Examine the directions if your valve is a various design from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
