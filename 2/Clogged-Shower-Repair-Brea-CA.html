The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

Assemblies not currently listed should have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
