<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas beverages. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe.

The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you select must be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed should have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
