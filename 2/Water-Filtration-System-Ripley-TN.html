Plumbing- If you are setting up a toilet in a brand-new or renovated bathroom, installation might require plumbing modifications, which will increase your total cost of installation.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
