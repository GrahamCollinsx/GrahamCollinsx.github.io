<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a threat to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
