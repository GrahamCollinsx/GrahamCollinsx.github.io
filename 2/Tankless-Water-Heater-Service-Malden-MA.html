<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated annually. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems need an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be tested every year to guarantee the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your house.

<p>This involves getting rid of harmed areas of old piping and installing new piping in its location when a repiping service is required. This is essential to support the plumbing system and make sure the structural integrity. Copper piping has actually been the standard for many years and is normally deemed the premier form of repiping. We use Type L" copper, which is the leading grade of copper. Our company believe that if you are going to buy copper piping, do it when, do it right.</p>
<p>Plastic pipe is a widely utilized product due to the fact that it is light-weight and versatile. Its seamlessness makes it a good material for installation in unsteady environments. Light-weight materials and compact construction equipment reduce the cost of repair and reduce environmental damage. However, if your water heater is over 10 years and is constantly having problems, an entire system replacement is the more affordable alternative. It will be much better to cope with a new, more effective system than to invest in regular repairs.</p>

To ensure your family and property are safe, and to get better, much healthier water, call us and find out about repiping your Fredericksburg house today.</p>
