<p>Potassium chloride is more pricey and adheres more strongly to the resin, lowering the exchange effectiveness when compared to sodium chloride. About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is used throughout the backflush operation. What we mean is that your toilet is old. Older toilets might work simply fine, however if your toilet is really old (and outdated in design), you may wish to think about a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.
