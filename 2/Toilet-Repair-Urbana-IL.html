<p>Conductor piping, when entering a City mix sewer, must be trapped, either separately or a single trap not to go beyond 10 inches in diameter. These traps shall consist of a cleanout to grade. Single traps will be set up, whenever possible, within 5 feet of the outside of outside walls. Some disposals are connected to the dishwasher, which enables self-cleaning.
