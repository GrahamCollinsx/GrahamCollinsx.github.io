<p>To help prevent blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the method set out above. Since the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially real when the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change instructions to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
