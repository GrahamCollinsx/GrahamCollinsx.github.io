When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain in addition to preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure versus back pressure.

<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be gotten rid of by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has actually already been fouled. Once again, it is recommended to examine the maker's directions for special precautions.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely regenerated.</p>
