<p>Examine the washer for wear or fractures when you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is inexpensive and simple. However finding the right washer may not be. The most typical washers are often available in the house centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be difficult to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
