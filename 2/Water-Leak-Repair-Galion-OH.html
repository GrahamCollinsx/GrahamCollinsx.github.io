<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This procedure continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about totally restored.</p>
