While there's not an exact timetable as to when you should repipe your house, you need to definitely look into repiping if they haven't been done in 50 years or more-- especially if you reside in an older house developed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our ac unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition.
