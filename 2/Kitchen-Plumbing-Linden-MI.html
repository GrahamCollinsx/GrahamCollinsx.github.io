<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than need (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly saved for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
