<p>pressure vacuum breakers: These are typically used in industrial plants, cooling towers, labs, laundries, pool, sprinkler system systems, and fire sprinkler systems. When water circulation stops, pressure vacuum breakers use a check valve created to close with the aid of a spring.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
