<p>More complicated is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has discovered widespread use given that it prevents both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are arranged in line with the pipeline and operate independently of each other. A set of 4 test dicks allow the operator to analyze the valves and ensure they are not being forced open by built up debris. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to permit water at awaited functional pressure to flow through. Should backflow happen, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, preventing the entrance of cross contamination water.</p>
