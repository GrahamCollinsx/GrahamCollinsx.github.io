Some will also flush your water heater at this time, which is an annual maintenance job that avoids difficult water and sediment accumulation. To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to rinse out any buildup.</p>

We'll reveal you one method to make each connection, however there are other equally genuine ways utilizing common plumbing parts.

The failure is an outcome of piping products and fittings breaking down, but is incorrectly credited to bad workmanship oftentimes.
