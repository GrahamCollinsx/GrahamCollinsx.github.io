Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the clog with negative pressure, it actually pushes into the blockage, working further into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip assists require it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
