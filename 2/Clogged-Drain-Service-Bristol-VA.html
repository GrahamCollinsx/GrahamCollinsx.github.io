<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation kit consists of a tube, or purchase one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
