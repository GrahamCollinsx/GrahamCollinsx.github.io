If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation kit consists of a tube, or purchase one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
