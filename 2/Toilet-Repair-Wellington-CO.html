<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Wellington CO</h3>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
<p>You could be losing money with every flush if your toilet was manufactured before 1994. Older toilets consume to 3.5 gallons per flush-- more than double the modern requirement.
