<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and removed. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any remaining contaminants.</p>
