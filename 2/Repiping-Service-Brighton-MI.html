<h3>How To Select A Credible Plumber Brighton MI</h3>
<p>Reverse osmosis is the process utilized to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are captured and eliminated. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any leftover pollutants.</p>
