It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational use, water pressure pushes the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really essential here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure versus back pressure.

IGD Plumbing can also help with this procedure if you have any special textures that need to be repaired.</p>
