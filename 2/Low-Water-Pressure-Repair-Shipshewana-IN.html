<p>A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line.

If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, reach you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
