About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is used throughout the backflush operation. What we suggest is that your toilet is old. Older toilets might work simply fine, however if your toilet is actually old (and obsoleted in design), you might want to consider a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.

The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated up, tough water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to decrease these signs.</p>
