This may hold true in some cases, but most of the time you will conserve yourself difficulty, money and time if you call a skilled plumber when you do not know anything about toilet repair.</p>

<p>When the specifications for a PVB can not be fulfilled, a Minimized Pressure-Principle (RP) - ASSE 1013 will be installed. Required to be outside, no constraint on elevation of sprinkler heads, and installed 18"- 60" above grade at the installed place.
