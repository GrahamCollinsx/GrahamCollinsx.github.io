<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high danger" establishments.</p>
