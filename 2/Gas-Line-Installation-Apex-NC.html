<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Apex NC</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a nuisance-- for its numerous desired usages around your home.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5). Inspect the directions if your valve is a different style from the one we show. After installing the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
