<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
