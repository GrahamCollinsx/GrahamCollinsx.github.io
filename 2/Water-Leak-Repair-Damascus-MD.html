Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
