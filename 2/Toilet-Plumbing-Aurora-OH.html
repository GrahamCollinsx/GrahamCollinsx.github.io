<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
