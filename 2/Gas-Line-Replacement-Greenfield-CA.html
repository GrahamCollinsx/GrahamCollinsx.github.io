Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific new sinks, however these will be identified to that result. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
