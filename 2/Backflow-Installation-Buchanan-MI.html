It's time to call a plumber if the fragrance of rotten eggs and sewage starts leaking out of your drains.</p>
<p>The normal option is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. If you live in an older home (built pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing, this is an alternative to think about. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
