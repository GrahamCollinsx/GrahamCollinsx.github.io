<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
