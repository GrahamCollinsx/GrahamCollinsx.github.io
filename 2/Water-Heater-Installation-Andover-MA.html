In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while liquified solids are caught and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to eliminate any remaining contaminants.</p>
<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid generally will assist remove them. , if you would like to attempt the gentlest approach perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust first.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola contains a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. Then utilize Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and security cautions initially!), if that does not do the technique. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust spots and it's readily available at a lot of hardware shops.</p>
