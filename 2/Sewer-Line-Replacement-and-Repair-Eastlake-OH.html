<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily saved for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
