<p>The term tough water" may seem like an oxymoron, however it's merely household water which contains high concentrations of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. These minerals do not make water unhealthy to consume. They also are reasonably undetectable through smell or taste, however they can be hazardous just the very same.

<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this salt water passes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about fully regenerated.</p>
