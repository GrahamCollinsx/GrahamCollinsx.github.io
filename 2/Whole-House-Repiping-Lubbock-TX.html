<p>Leakages can occur if the seal in between the tank and bowl fails, or the seal at the floor drain fails. Because the tank or the entire toilet need to be lifted off the floor for a correct repair, either of these leakages can be tough to fix by yourself.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
