<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The simplest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is necessary to get rid of the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its design and lack of moving parts. However, it might be unwise in lots of scenarios to install a pipe sector of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
