<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
<p>Hybrid Heatpump Water Heaters: A combination of a traditional water tank storage with a heatpump, hybrid heatpump hot water heater draw out heat from the air to help heat the water.

However does every WaterPro client need to install a backflow prevention device? The answer is: you need backflow prevention if you have a culinary water connection that might be utilized to supply a sprinkler system.</p>
