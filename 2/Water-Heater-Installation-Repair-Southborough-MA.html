<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Southborough MA</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
<p>As toilets get older, they have to work harder to do their tasks. Harder work suggests more water. Even if your toilet functions efficiently, it's also possible that it's simply an old style that uses a lot of water. If you're worried about your water expense, consider changing your old toilet with a modern-day low-flow model. The new low-flow toilets work simply as successfully as any other kind of toilet, and you'll conserve an unexpected amount on your bill.</p>
