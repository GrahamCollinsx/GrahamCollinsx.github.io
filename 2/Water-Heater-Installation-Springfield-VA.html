<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Springfield VA</h3>

A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not commonly specified by water purveyors.  It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to lie a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
