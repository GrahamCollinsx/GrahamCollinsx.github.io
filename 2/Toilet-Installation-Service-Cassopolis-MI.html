If the bypass valve is cracked, it can likewise trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed in time. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth processes.
