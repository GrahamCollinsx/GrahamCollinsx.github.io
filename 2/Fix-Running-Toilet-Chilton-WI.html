Subsequently residential authorizations released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated yearly. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked annually to guarantee the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.
