If your current toilet is nearing completion of its lifespan, or perhaps if you're simply tired of costs excessive on your water costs, we can replace it with a brand-new design that uses less water.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
