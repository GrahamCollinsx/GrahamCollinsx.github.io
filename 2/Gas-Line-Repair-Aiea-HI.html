There's always the chance that your plumber's previous task will run long and postpone the beginning time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next visit, they likely rushed the task (unless you have an extremely little plumbing system). When you contact us to schedule your consultation, ask for how long the inspection typically takes.</p>
<p>Line up the rubber seal ring on the top of the disposer with the flange beneath the sink. Press it into place, and loosely secure it by turning the lower installing ring onto the ramp tabs of the upper mounting ring. Turn disposer system as needed to align drain assembly. There's a nasty odor coming from your drains - You might not see this right away, but foul smells indicate whatever is stuck in your drains-- most likely food waste-- is rotting in there.
