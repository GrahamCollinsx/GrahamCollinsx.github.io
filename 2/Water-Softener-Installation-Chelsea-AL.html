<p>Even if all appears well with your water heater, it's a great idea to schedule hot water heater service from time to time just to make certain that everything is kosher. Sediment accumulation is a common issue with water heaters New Orleans, especially in older systems. In time, calcium, limescale, and magnesium can collect on the sides of the tank and around the burner. These minerals need to be removed of the unit so they don't create a sediment barrier on the burner and interfere with hot water heater efficiency. Hot water heater filtration can flush out these minerals and avoid a malfunction. The burner should also be checked periodically to make sure that the flame is blue with a yellow pointer. If the flame is yellow-orange, it will affect your water heater's efficiency, and it might release carbon monoxide fumes into your indoor air.</p>

Changed out electrical cords since the original looked excellent. Including tax, I spent less than $125 to install it myself. Not very complicated. Thank God for YouTube Videos.</p>
