<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
