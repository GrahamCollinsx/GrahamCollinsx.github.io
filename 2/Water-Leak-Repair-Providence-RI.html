<p>To help avoid obstructions within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the method set out above. Due to the fact that the baffle efficiently halves the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially true.
