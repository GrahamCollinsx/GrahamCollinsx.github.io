The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to leave. Sometimes no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down lead to a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
