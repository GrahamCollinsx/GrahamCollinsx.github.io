<p>Normal causes of problems in sewer lines are tree root intrusion, clogs (such as foreign things, toilet paper, grease, and other particles), deterioration, and broken seals or joints between areas of sewer line. House owners are responsible for preserving, fixing, and changing natural gas pipes that run from the utility's gas meter to the house's natural gas devices. When the source of a gas leak or other issue is on a consumer's natural gas pipe or associated connections, repair costs can be high.</p>
