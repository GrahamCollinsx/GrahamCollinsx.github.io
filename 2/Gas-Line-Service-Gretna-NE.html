For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to solidify and break or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything remains in good shape.</p>
