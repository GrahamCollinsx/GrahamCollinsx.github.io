<p>More complex is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has discovered widespread usage because it prevents both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are organized in line with the pipeline and operate separately of each other. A set of four test cocks enable the operator to examine the valves and ensure they are not being forced open by accumulated particles. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to allow water at expected functional pressure to stream through. Should backflow happen, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, preventing the entrance of cross contamination water.</p>
