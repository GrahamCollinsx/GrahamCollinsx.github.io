<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

<p>When a natural gas line is ruptured, it immediately ends up being a major safety threat.
