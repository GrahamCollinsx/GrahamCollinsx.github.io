<p>The Mesopotamians presented the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 utilised to remove wastewater from websites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk includes the earliest known examples of brick built Latrines, built atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had replaceable and quickly detachable sections, and allowed for cleaning.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>

Testing should be completed within 30 days from the date of the letter.
