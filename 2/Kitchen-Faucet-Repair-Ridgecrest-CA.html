This is particularly true when the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change instructions to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free.

This assembly also enables the closure of one valve to decrease the pressure differential across the other, creating a more reliable seal and avoiding even minor backflow leak. Test dicks, or small ball valves, allow the accessory of testing devices that evaluates whether the check assembly is practical.</p>
