A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Often a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
