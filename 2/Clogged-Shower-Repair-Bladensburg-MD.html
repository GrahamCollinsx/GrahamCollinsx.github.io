<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 stages. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are captured and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any leftover contaminants.</p>
<p>Malfunctioning parts: If you have an electric hot water heater, a malfunctioning thermostat or a tripped breaker can trigger problems. If you have a gas unit, the pilot burner may head out, resulting in little or no warm water. In general, traditional water heaters are anticipated to last 7-10 years with appropriate maintenance. Inspect the age of the existing water heater if you're moving into a brand-new home.
