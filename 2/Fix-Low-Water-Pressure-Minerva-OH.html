Residences that use gas for heat or for other numerous home appliances have a gas line that connects directly to the furnace, water heater, stove, and other appliances that use gas. The most typical gas utilized for residential homes is natural gas. Utility companies provide this gas to homes through an underground pipe system.</p>
<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high danger" facilities.</p>
