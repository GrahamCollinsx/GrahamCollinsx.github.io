<p>Recognition of gas, air and liquid leaks: Using electronic, acoustical and thermal imaging finding equipment to recognize leaks. Whether you need garbage disposal repair or installation, Maeser can help. A waste disposal unit is a vital kitchen appliance in most homes today. While a lot of kitchen sink disposers can deal with nearly any sort of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other item jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being inefficient, increasing the risk of drain clogs.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
