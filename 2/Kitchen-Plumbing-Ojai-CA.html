<p>Try to find a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will stream backwards into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost during these occasions.</p>

<p>A reduction in supply side pressure caused by an occurrence such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, causes the supply pressure to drop below the consumer side pressure.

Water will discharge up until the supply side pressure again exceeds the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>She knew about the service call fee. The 4 In Your Corner Examination found that's a typical cost. Consumer Private investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get an estimate from personal plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement.

Brooks found only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
