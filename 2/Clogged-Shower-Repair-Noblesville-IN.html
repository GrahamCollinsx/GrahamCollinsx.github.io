Plumbing codes mandate that drinkable water products be protected versus backflow at all cross-connections. We offer the largest selection of backflow prevention solutions for any application.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in critical locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>

A clogged drain can even result in sluggish water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and pricey repairs.</p>
