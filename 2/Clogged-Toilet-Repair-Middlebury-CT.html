<p>Most toilets used today run with a basic gravity flushing design, suggesting they utilize the force of the gravity to push the clean water into the bowl and then on into the sewage system. Just recently, nevertheless, toilets utilizing a vacuum flushing system have actually been appearing in a growing number of houses. This system utilizes a vacuum-assisted flushing system to suck the water into the bowl and down into the sewage systems.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of home centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close.
