Our premium system, the EC4 entire home water softener, is a modern product that utilizes a process of ion exchange to remove the minerals that cause difficult water. By replacing the bicarbonate, magnesium, and calcium ions that trigger water solidity with salt or potassium ions, the EC4 softens hard water by resolving its source. Furthermore, thanks to its special, built-in microprocessor, the EC4 system will learn your normal water usage patterns, adjusting its soft water shipment based upon your requirements.

The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is heated up, difficult water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these symptoms.</p>
