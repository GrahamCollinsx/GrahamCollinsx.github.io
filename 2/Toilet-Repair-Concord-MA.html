<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high threat" establishments.</p>

This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about fully regrowed.</p>
