Both are more reliable and cheaper than versatile stainless steel adapters, which are not constantly allowed. Use stiff copper instead of versatile copper water system lines for the exact same factors. Plumbing- If you are installing a toilet in a new or refurbished bathroom, installation may require plumbing modifications, which will increase your general cost of installation.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
