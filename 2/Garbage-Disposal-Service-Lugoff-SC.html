<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water flow. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to get away. In some cases no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down results in a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content.

More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
