To prep your system for installation, you may need to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug kit that I purchased individually from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>

We made the decision to stick with Joe, even though we felt Mr Rooter costs were certainly on the luxury. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
