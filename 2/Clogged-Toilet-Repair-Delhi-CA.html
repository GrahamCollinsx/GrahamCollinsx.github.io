<p>Leaks are tricky. While the time needed will vary based on your house size and the number of discovered malfunctions, it's best to set aside approximately two hours when you arrange an inspection. There's always the opportunity that your plumber's previous task will run long and postpone the starting time.

When you call to arrange your appointment, ask how long the inspection normally takes.</p>
