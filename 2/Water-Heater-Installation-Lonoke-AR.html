<p>Your Local Plumbing, Heating & Cooling Experts Since 1938. You'll discover the difference the first time you bathe or shower with softened water. Soft water feels visibly smooth to the skin.

High water pressure causes leaks, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to occur without appropriate pressure reduction.</p>
