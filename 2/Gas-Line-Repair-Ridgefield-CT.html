<p>While city water does get treated, it is done for purposes of eliminating bacterial issues and making the water drinkable. These are definitely top priorities for a municipality and its homeowners but hard water can negatively impact faucets and home appliances in a home. With the high calcium material of local water, it can trigger a dishwasher or hot water heater to breakdown. If the problem is repeating or the damage is extensive, you might be much better off repiping. For one-off problems and minor leakages, fixing the pipe is normally enough.</p>

When the pipes start to corrode, it affects your water system. Contaminated water is a health risk and must be handled quickly. Rust can also break, break, or burst pipes and destroy your floors or walls. We correct little leaks without repiping, however if you experience chronic leakage or a slab leak, it might be time for a total plumbing overhaul.</p>
<p>After eliminating standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and after that flush with hot water to clear the mix. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water coming from your water appliances? This is a great indicator that your pipes may be rusting from the inside and therefore, need to be changed. Bear in mind that if the rust-colored water only comes with hot water, the cause could be a rusted out water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>
