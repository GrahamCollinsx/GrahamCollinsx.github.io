<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water circulation. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to escape. Often no apparent physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down results in a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>

Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
