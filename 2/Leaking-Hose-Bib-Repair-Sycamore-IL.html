For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
