It may not be installed in any place where it might ever be submerged under water. Some municipalities do not enable the use of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some don't allow the use of a PVB at all, so check with your water service provider.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a process called ion exchange to eliminate hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical procedure called Template Assisted Formation (TAC). This procedure converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a solidity crystal that won't stick to any surface area in your home, keeping your devices and warm water heaters without difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are likewise called water conditioners due to the fact that they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And because these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to get rid of captured ions.</p>
